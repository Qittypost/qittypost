Introduction</h1> <h2 id="who">Who are we</h2> <p>QittyPostBot is a commercial project created to expand opportunities and simplify the creation of posts in Telegram channels.</p> <h2 id="why">Why the privacy policy was created</h2> <p>The privacy policy was created to outline how our organization collects, uses, stores, and protects users' personal information. It ensures transparency and builds trust with users by informing them about their rights and how their data is handled. Another reason for creating a privacy policy is to comply with Telegram's requirements regarding data handling and user privacy. Additionally, a privacy policy helps organizations meet legal requirements and regulations related to data protection.</p> <h1 id="collect">2.
